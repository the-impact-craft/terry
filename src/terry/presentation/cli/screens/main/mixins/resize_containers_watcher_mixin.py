    Watches and handles the resizing of containers in a user interface.

    The ResizeContainersWatcher class provides functionality to manage and respond
    to events related to resizing operations. It handles events for selecting,
    moving, and releasing resizing rules, ensuring that the resizing operation is
    properly executed and the state is consistently maintained. This class also
    manages interactions like dragging and concludes resizing tasks when necessary.

    Class should be used as a mixin in classes that require resizing functionality
    and is inherited from textual App.
